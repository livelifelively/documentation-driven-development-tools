## Test Results

### Current Status

- **Total Tests**: 222
- **Passing Tests**: 199 (89.6%)
- **Failing Tests**: 23 (10.4%)

### Test Categories

- **Core Tests**: 11/11 passing (100%)
- **Section Tests**: 40/40 passing (100%)
- **Subsection Tests**: 58/58 passing (100%)
- **Validation Tests**: 105/128 passing (82%)
- **Accessibility Tests**: 8/11 passing (73%)

### Failing Tests Analysis

The 23 failing tests are primarily related to:

1. **Schema structure changes** - Tests need updates for new non-functional requirements structure
2. **Backward compatibility** - Some tests need adjustment for new schema structure
3. **Integration point structure** - Tests need updates for new required upstream/downstream structure

## Key Features

### Independent Section Validation

Each section has its own identity and validation flow via the `byId` index, allowing validation irrespective of parent sections.

### Dual Validation Approach

Tests include both:

- **byId validation** - Direct section validation via `byId['section.id']`
- **Composed schema validation** - Validation within parent context

### Document Type Support

- **Plan documents** - Full schema with all sections
- **Task documents** - Task-specific sections only

### Deep Nested Support

- Support for deep nested sections (e.g., 4.1.5.1, 4.2.5.1)
- Individual schema factories for each subsection
- Proper byId registration for all levels

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test -- src/doc-parser/validation/__tests__/4-high-level-design/index.test.ts
```

### Run Specific Test Files

```bash
# Core tests only
npm test -- src/doc-parser/validation/__tests__/4-high-level-design/core.test.ts

# Subsection tests only
npm test -- src/doc-parser/validation/__tests__/4-high-level-design/subsections.test.ts

# Section tests only
npm test -- src/doc-parser/validation/__tests__/4-high-level-design/sections.test.ts
```

### Run with Verbose Output

```bash
npm test -- src/doc-parser/validation/__tests__/4-high-level-design/index.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

## Schema Architecture

### Factory Pattern

The schema uses a factory pattern with individual factories for each section type:

- `createDataModelsSchema`
- `createComponentsSchema`
- `createDataFlowSchema`
- `createControlFlowSchema`
- `createIntegrationPointsSchema`
- `createPerformanceSchema`
- `createSecuritySchema`
- `createReliabilitySchema`
- `createPermissionModelSchema`
- `createUpstreamIntegrationsSchema`
- `createDownstreamIntegrationsSchema`

### byId Registration

All sections are registered in a `byId` index for direct access:

```typescript
const byId = (createHighLevelDesignSchema('plan') as any).__byId;
const dataModelsSchema = byId['4.2.1'];
```

### Document Type Applicability

Sections are marked with applicability rules:

- **Plan-only**: 4.0, 4.1, 4.1.x
- **Both**: 4.2, 4.2.x, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4.x

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Sections

1. Create individual schema factory
2. Register in appropriate section factory
3. Add tests to subsections.test.ts
4. Update byId verification tests

### Schema Changes

1. Update factory functions
2. Update test data to match new structure
3. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Update documentation

### Test Organization

- Keep tests focused and organized by section
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both valid and invalid scenarios
- Test both byId and composed validation approaches
