# Documentation Schema (Plan/Task Composable Hierarchy) - Human Version

This file defines **which information appears where** in our Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) Plan/Task Composable Hierarchy and **why**. Use it as the canonical source when updating templates or building automation.

**Methodology Overview**: The Plan/Task Composable Hierarchy is a flexible documentation structure where Plans define strategic direction and can contain other Plans or Tasks based on complexity. This composable approach allows documentation architecture to scale naturally with project needs, from simple single-level structures to complex multi-level hierarchies.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning                |
| :----- | :--------------------- |
| ‚úÖ     | Required               |
| ‚ùì     | Optional (recommended) |
| ‚ûñ     | Not applicable / omit  |

**Note on Usage in Document Headings:** In addition to their meaning in the schema tables below, these icons are used in the headings of the actual `*.md` files to indicate the **completion status** of a section.

```md
- `## ‚úÖ [Section Name]`: Indicates the section is considered **complete**.
- `## ‚ùì [Section Name]`: Indicates the section is **incomplete, a placeholder, or needs review**.
- `## ‚ûñ [Section Name]`: Indicates the section is **not applicable** and has been intentionally omitted.

Each document begins with relevant **family headings** (`## Business & Scope`, etc.). A document includes a family only if it has relevant content; otherwise the heading may read `None (inherits from parent)`.

## Context Inheritance Protocol

The Plan/Task Composable Hierarchy uses a strict protocol for context inheritance through **progressive narrowing**. To correctly interpret any document, you must gather context by reading from the top-level Plan downward.

### Traversal Process:

- **Identify the hierarchy chain** for your target document
- **Read top-down** starting from the root Plan, progressively narrowing scope
- **Each Plan adds specificity** to the context established by its parent
- **Tasks inherit** the complete context chain from their parent Plan

### Examples:

For `p1-p2-t1-user-endpoints.task.md`:

- Read `project.plan.md` (broadest strategic context)
- Read `p1-backend.plan.md` (backend-specific context)
- Read `p1-p2-api.plan.md` (API-specific context)
- Read `p1-p2-t1-user-endpoints.task.md` (implementation details)

For `p1-t1-database-setup.task.md`:

- Read `project.plan.md` (strategic context)
- Read `p1-backend.plan.md` (backend context)
- Read `p1-t1-database-setup.task.md` (implementation details)

This top-down traversal ensures each document receives progressively narrowed, inherited context. Information is never repeated - it flows downward through the hierarchy. Automated tools and LLMs **MUST** enforce this reading order.

## 1 Meta & Governance <a id="meta--governance"></a>

### Rationale

Keeps humans and CI aware of health, urgency, and blockers at any zoom level without polluting design content. Static plan docs carry only a pointer; live status tables sit in dedicated \*-status.md companions (and inside each Task doc).

### Depth Matrix

### Field Details

#### 2.1 Overview

- **Description**: Provide a concise, bulleted list outlining what this artefact delivers and why it matters.
- **Content Format**: Markdown bulleted list.
- **Notes**: Plan: Strategic identity & value proposition. Task: Specific deliverable & implementation objective.

- **Example**:

> - **Core Function**: Implements a robust, multi-level logging system for the document processing pipeline.
> - **Key Capability**: Ensures both operational errors and business events are captured, categorized, and routed to monitoring tools.
> - **Business Value**: Enables proactive issue resolution and performance analysis.

#### 2.2 Business Context

- **Description**: Provides the narrative and domain-specific details behind the work. If no additional context beyond the parent level is needed, this section can contain `None (inherits from parent)`.
- **Content Format**: Markdown text, with optional `####` sub-headings for child sections (Key Workflows, etc.).
- **Notes**: Strategic context including User Journeys, User Personas, Core Business Rules.

- **Example**:

> Currently, pipeline failures are opaque, requiring developers to manually inspect logs, which slows down resolution time. This new logging system will provide structured, queryable data to our analytics dashboard, allowing support staff to diagnose issues without engineering intervention.

#### 2.2.1 User Journeys

- **Description**: A container for one or more `Journey` sections. This section should provide a complete overview of all primary user paths and interactions related to the document.

#### 2.2.1.1 Journey: [Name]

- **Description**: A self-contained description of a single, specific user journey. The `[Name]` in the heading should be replaced with a descriptive title for the journey (e.g., "Analyst Processes a New Document"). This section must include a brief narrative explaining the journey's context and a diagram to visualize the flow.
- **Content Format**: A `#####` heading, a brief narrative description, and a Mermaid `graph` or `sequenceDiagram`. This section can be repeated as many times as necessary to document all relevant journeys.
- **Notes**: A repeatable section for a single, named user journey, including a description and diagram.

- **Example**:

> ##### Journey: Analyst Processes a New Document
>
> This journey describes the end-to-end path for a data analyst supervising the processing of a single document from selection to completion.

> ```mermaid
> graph
> A("Start") --> B["Selects Document"];
> B --> C("Completes Pipeline");
> ```

> ##### Journey: DevOps Engineer Monitors Pipeline Health
>
> This journey describes how a DevOps engineer interacts with the system's outputs to monitor for errors and performance issues.

> ```mermaid
> sequenceDiagram
> participant Pipeline
> participant Logger
> participant DevOps
> Pipeline-->>Logger: Log "Processing Failed" (ERROR)
> DevOps->>Logger: Views and analyzes error
> ```

#### 2.2.3 Core Business Rules

- **Description**: Enumerate domain rules that apply to this artefact.
- **Content Format**: Markdown list.
- **Notes**: Plan: Domain rules that govern this scope. Task: Implementation-specific business constraints.

> - Log retention period is 90 days for `INFO` and 1 year for `ERROR` and above.

#### 2.2.4 User Stories

- **Description**: A list of user-centric stories that describe a piece of functionality from the end-user's perspective. This section is most critical for Plans but can be used at the Task level if it provides necessary context. The format "As a [persona], I want [to perform an action], so that I can [achieve a goal]" is recommended.
- **Content Format**: Markdown list.
- **Notes**: User-centric goals and workflows relevant to this Plan scope.

- **Example**:

> - As a DevOps Engineer, I want to receive a real-time alert when a critical error occurs, so that I can immediately begin troubleshooting.
> - As a Support Analyst, I want to filter logs by user ID, so that I can quickly investigate user-reported issues.

#### 2.3 Success Criteria

- **Description**: Measurable or binary statements that define when a Plan is considered complete for its current phase.
- **Content Format**: Markdown list.
- **Notes**: How we know this Plan's strategic objectives are achieved.

- **Example**:

> - All pipeline stages emit structured logs for success, failure, and key business events.
> - The central dashboard can successfully ingest and display logs from all pipeline stages.
> - A comprehensive set of alerts for critical failures is configured and tested.

#### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

- **Description**: A verifiable, tabular list of conditions that a Task must satisfy to be considered complete.

> | :--- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
> | AC-1 | Logger correctly filters messages below `minLevel`. | `logger.test.ts`    |
> | AC-2 | `FATAL` level logs trigger a PagerDuty alert.       | `alerting.int.test` |
> | AC-3 | Log output is valid JSON.                           | `formatter.test.ts` |

#### 2.5 Boundaries & Scope

- **Description**: A container heading for the explicit definition of the work's boundaries. Its content is in the child sections `2.5.1 In Scope` and `2.5.2 Out of Scope`.
- **Notes**: Container heading for scope definitions.
