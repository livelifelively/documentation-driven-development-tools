# Best Practices and Framework Review for Task: Core Engine & Markdown Parser

## Best Practices Compliance

The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to both general and framework-specific best practices.

- **API Design**: The public API exposed in `index.ts` is exemplary. It is asynchronous, well-typed, and provides a clear, minimal surface area (`parseTask`, `lintTask`). This makes it easy for other tools (like a CLI or git hook) to consume. **Score: 5/5**
- **Dependency Management**: The project uses a minimal and appropriate set of dependencies (`unified`, `remark`, `glob`). There are no unnecessary or bloated libraries. **Score: 5/5**
- **Observability**: The logging strategy is appropriate for a development tool. The core API correctly returns errors programmatically, while the parts of the system that discover plugins use `console.warn` to provide non-critical feedback without failing the entire process. **Score: 5/5**

## Language-Specific Assessment

The code is a great example of modern, idiomatic TypeScript.

- **Language Idioms**: The code correctly uses modern TypeScript features, including `async/await` for handling promises, ES modules for organization, and strong typing with interfaces (`SectionProcessor`, `ParseResult`). **Score: 5/5**
- **Error Handling**: The error handling pattern of using `try...catch` with `async/await` and throwing `Error` objects is correctly implemented and follows standard best practices. **Score: 5/5**
- **Code Style**: The code is clean, well-formatted, and adheres to community-standard TypeScript style guides.

**Conclusion:** The implementation follows best practices for building a modern, maintainable TypeScript library. The code is idiomatic, clean, and leverages its dependencies effectively. No improvements are required in this area.
