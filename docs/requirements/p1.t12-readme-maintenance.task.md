## 2 Business & Scope

### 2.1 Overview

- **Core Function**: To create and maintain a comprehensive `README.md` file for the `ddd-tools` repository.
- **Key Capability**: The `README.md` will serve as the primary entry point for new users, explaining the project's purpose, features, and usage.
- **Business Value**: A high-quality README is crucial for project adoption, developer onboarding, and establishing clear, accessible documentation for the toolset.

## 6 Implementation Guidance

### 6.1 Implementation Log / Steps

- [ ] **Create File**: Create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory.
- [ ] **Title and Badge**: Add a main title `# DDD Tools` and a placeholder for an NPM version badge.
- [ ] **Description**: Write a project description based on the `p1.p2-cli-tools.plan.md` overview. Explain that the tool helps enforce Documentation-Driven Development.
- [ ] **Core Concepts**: Briefly explain the DDD workflow: `Document -> Implement -> Validate`. Mention the Plan/Task hierarchy.
- [ ] **Installation**: Add a section explaining how to install the tool globally (`npm install -g ddd-tools`).
- [ ] **Usage Section**: Create a main "Usage" section with subsections for each command.
- [ ] **`ddd template`**:
  - Explain its purpose: creating new plan and task files.
  - Provide usage syntax: `ddd template <type> <name> --parent <parent-filename>`.
  - Include examples for creating a root plan, a nested plan, and a task, based on `p1-p2.t3-template-commands.task.md`.
- [ ] **`ddd start`**:
  - Explain its purpose: starting work on a task.
  - Provide usage syntax: `ddd start <task_id>`.
  - Describe what it does: creates a `task/<task_id>` branch and updates the task file's status.
- [ ] **`ddd commit`**:
  - Explain its purpose: creating a compliant commit message.
  - Provide usage syntax: `ddd commit`.
  - Describe the interactive prompts (`type`, `scope`, `subject`) and the final commit message format.
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Add a small section explaining how the Git hooks (`commit-msg`) enforce the workflow, based on `p1-p2-p3.t9-git-hooks.task.md`.
- [ ] **Contributing**: Add a brief section about contributing, mentioning that the project itself follows the DDD methodology.
- [ ] **Review**: Review the entire document for clarity, grammar, and formatting.

### 6.1.1 Initial Situation

- No `README.md` file exists in the repository.
