# Workflow: Plan Documentation

## Workflow Definition

### Objective

To collaboratively create a comprehensive `*.plan.md` document that serves as the strategic foundation for a project or a major component, ensuring all business, architectural, and planning requirements are defined before any sub-plans or implementation tasks begin.

### Participants

- Human Developer
- AI Assistant

### Trigger

A new project, feature, or complex component is initiated that requires strategic planning and architectural design, necessitating the creation of a new `*.plan.md` document.

### Control Model

**Collaborative (Peer)** - The Human Developer and AI Assistant work together to create the plan document. The process is iterative, with the Human providing strategic direction and context, and the AI drafting sections and ensuring schema compliance.

## Core Principles of a Workflow Document

A workflow document is not passive documentation; it is an **executable instruction set** for an AI assistant. Every workflow we create must adhere to the following principles:

- **Single, Prime Objective:** Each workflow must have a single, clearly defined `Objective`.
- **Defined Trigger:** The specific event that initiates the workflow must be stated.
- **Clear Participants:** The roles (e.g., Human Developer, AI Assistant) must be listed.
- **Phased Approach:** The workflow must be broken down into logical phases, each with a clear goal.
- **Action-Oriented Steps:** Each step must be a clear, actionable instruction for a specific participant.
- **Checkpoints & Outcomes:** Each phase must conclude with a verifiable checkpoint and a defined outcome or exit criteria.

## High-Level Phases

- **Phase 1: Scaffolding and Business Context** - Establish the plan's foundation (Families 1 & 2).
- **Phase 2: Architectural Design and Decomposition** - Define the technical approach and task breakdown (Families 3 & 4).
- **Phase 3: Implementation and Operational Planning** - Define maintenance and implementation guidance (Families 5 & 6).
- **Phase 4: Quality and Testing Strategy** - Define the complete quality and testing plan (Family 7).
- **Phase 5: Final Review and Approval** - Conduct a final review and add supplementary materials (Family 8 & Finalization).

## Phase 1: Scaffolding and Business Context

**Goal:** To establish the plan's foundation by defining its purpose, scope, and business drivers, ensuring alignment on _why_ the work is being done. This phase populates the initial sections of the `*.plan.md` document, corresponding to Schema Families 1 and 2.

1.  **Human's Action: Initiate the Plan**

    - Create a new `[parent-chain].[p{id}-{name}].plan.md` file using the official template.
    - Provide the high-level objective. For example: _"We need a plan for the new NPM publication system."_

2.  **AI Assistant's Action: Draft Initial Sections**

    - Populate the **`1.2 Status`** section with creation and update timestamps.
    - Based on the objective, draft a first pass of the **`2.1 Overview`**, outlining the core function and business value.
    - Draft the **`2.5 Boundaries & Scope`** section, proposing clear "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" items to establish the project's boundaries.

3.  **Human's Action: Provide Business Context**

    - Fill in the core business details:
      - **`2.2 Business Context`**: The narrative explaining the "why."
      - **`2.2.1 User Journeys`**: Define the key user paths.
      - **`2.2.2 User Personas`**: Define the target users.
      - **`2.2.3 Core Business Rules`**: List the critical business constraints.
      - **`2.2.4 User Stories`**: List the primary user goals.

4.  **AI Assistant's Action: Refine and Define Success**

    - Review the business context provided by the human.
    - Draft the **`2.3 Success Criteria`**, translating the business goals into measurable success metrics for the plan.
    - Draft the **`1.3 Priority Drivers`** by selecting the appropriate driver IDs from the master list based on the provided context.

5.  **Checkpoint: Business Alignment Review**
    - The Human and AI Assistant jointly review all sections from Families 1 and 2.

**Exit Criteria:** All sections within "Meta & Governance" and "Business & Scope" are complete and accurately reflect a shared understanding of the plan's strategic goals and boundaries.

## Phase 2: Architectural Design and Decomposition

**Goal:** To iteratively define the decomposition of work and the supporting high-level technical architecture, ensuring they are aligned.

**Core Principle for this Phase:** While the final document places Decomposition (Family 3) before Architecture (Family 4) for readability, the _creation_ of these sections is iterative. The **`3.1 Roadmap`** and the **`4.2 Target Architecture`** (including its sub-sections like Data Models, Components, and Data Flow) are the most consequential outputs of a Plan. These sections are non-negotiable and must be completed in the prescribed formats.

1.  **Human & AI's Action: Iterative Design Loop**

    - **a. Discuss High-Level Architecture:** Before writing, briefly discuss the likely architectural approach.
    - **b. Draft Architecture (Family 4):** Based on the discussion, the AI drafts the core sections of **`4. High-Level Design`**, including the **`4.4 Non-Functional Requirements`**. This draft establishes the technical foundation.
    - **c. Draft Decomposition (Family 3):** With the architectural foundation in place, the AI drafts a realistic **`3. Planning & Decomposition`**.
    - **d. Refine and Align:** The Human and AI review both Family 3 and Family 4 together until they are consistent and stable.

2.  **Checkpoint: Technical Design Review**
    - The Human and AI Assistant jointly review the final, aligned sections from Families 3 and 4.

**Exit Criteria:** The decomposition and high-level technical design are approved, documented, and mutually consistent.

## Phase 3: Implementation and Operational Planning

**Goal:** To define the maintenance, monitoring, and implementation guidance for the project. This phase populates Schema Families 5 and 6.

1.  **AI Assistant's Action: Draft Operational and Implementation Sections**

    - **Family 5 (Maintenance & Monitoring):** Draft the `5.2 Target Maintenance and Monitoring` sections, including Error Handling and Logging strategies.
    - **Family 6 (Implementation Guidance):** Draft the `6.1 Implementation Plan` if a phased rollout is needed.

2.  **Human's Action: Review and Refine**

    - Review the proposed strategies for monitoring and implementation.
    - Ensure the plans are robust and feasible.

3.  **Checkpoint: Operational and Implementation Review**
    - The Human and AI Assistant jointly review and approve all sections from Families 5 and 6.

**Exit Criteria:** All sections within Families 5 and 6 are documented and approved.

---

## Phase 4: Quality and Testing Strategy

**Goal:** To define the complete quality assurance, testing, configuration, and deployment strategy for the project. This phase populates all of Schema Family 7.

1.  **AI Assistant's Action: Draft Quality and Operations Sections**

    - Propose a detailed **`7.1 Testing Strategy / Requirements`**.
    - Define the **`7.2 Configuration`** approach for different environments.
    - Outline **`7.3 Alerting & Response`** protocols.
    - Detail the **`7.4 Deployment Steps`**.

2.  **Human's Action: Review and Approve Quality Plan**

    - Review the testing strategy, configuration, alerting, and deployment plans for completeness and correctness.
    - This is a critical checkpoint to ensure the project can be delivered and operated with high quality.

3.  **Checkpoint: Quality and Operations Review**
    - The Human and AI Assistant jointly review and approve all sections from Family 7.

**Exit Criteria:** All sections within Family 7 are documented and approved.

---

## Phase 5: Final Review and Approval

**Goal:** To conduct a final holistic review, add any supplementary reference material, and formally approve the plan.

1.  **AI Assistant's Action: Prepare for Final Review**

    - **Family 8 (Reference):** Add any necessary appendices, glossaries, or links to external resources.
    - Ensure all other sections are complete, links are working, and formatting is consistent.
    - Announce that the plan is ready for final approval.

2.  **Human's Action: Final Approval**
    - Read the finalized `*.plan.md` document from top to bottom.
    - Give final approval, marking the plan as the official source of truth.

**Outcome:** The plan is approved and work on its child tasks can begin.
