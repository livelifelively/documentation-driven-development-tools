# Workflow: Implementation Planning

## Workflow Definition

### Objective

To generate a prioritized list of tasks that are ready for implementation by analyzing dependencies across the entire project and calculating an aggregated priority for each task.

### Participants

- Human Developer
- AI Assistant

### Trigger

A developer is ready to begin work on the next set of tasks and requests a prioritized work plan.

### Control Model

**Collaborative (Peer)** - The Human Developer and AI Assistant work together to generate the plan. The process is interactive, with the AI providing analysis and the Human providing direction and making final decisions.

## Core Principles of a Workflow Document

A workflow document is not passive documentation; it is an **executable instruction set** for an AI assistant. Every workflow we create must adhere to the following principles:

- **Single, Prime Objective:** Each workflow must have a single, clearly defined `Objective`.
- **Defined Trigger:** The specific event that initiates the workflow must be stated.
- **Clear Participants:** The roles (e.g., Human Developer, AI Assistant) must be listed.
- **Phased Approach:** The workflow must be broken down into logical phases, each with a clear goal.
- **Action-Oriented Steps:** Each step must be a clear, actionable instruction for a specific participant.
- **Checkpoints & Outcomes:** Each phase must conclude with a verifiable checkpoint and a defined outcome or exit criteria.

## High-Level Phases

- **Phase 1: Project-Wide Data Aggregation** - Scan all documentation to build a model of all tasks and their dependencies.
- **Phase 2: Analysis and Prioritization** - Filter for ready tasks and calculate their aggregated priority.
- **Phase 3: Report Generation** - Produce a clear, actionable work plan.

## Phase 1: Project-Wide Data Aggregation

**Goal:** For the AI Assistant to build a complete model of the project's tasks, plans, dependencies, and priorities.

1.  **Human's Action: Initiate Planning**

    - _"Please generate the implementation plan."_

2.  **AI Assistant's Action: Scan and Model**

    - Recursively scan the project for all `*.plan.md` and `*.task.md` files.
    - For each file, parse its `Priority`, `Dependencies`, and `Status`.
    - Build an in-memory graph of the entire project hierarchy and the dependency relationships between all tasks and plans.

3.  **Checkpoint: Aggregation Confirmation**
    - The AI Assistant confirms it has processed all files.
    - _"I have scanned all documentation and built a project model. I am ready to analyze the tasks."_

**Exit Criteria:** The AI has a complete, in-memory representation of the project's structure and dependencies.

## Phase 2: Analysis and Prioritization

**Goal:** To identify all tasks that are ready for implementation and to calculate a final priority score for them.

1.  **AI Assistant's Action: Dependency Analysis**

    - Traverse the project graph and identify all tasks whose documented dependencies are met (i.e., the dependency tasks are marked as "Complete").
    - Filter out any tasks that are not in a "Not Started" state.

2.  **AI Assistant's Action: Aggregated Priority Calculation**
    - For each "ready" task, calculate its aggregated priority.
    - The priority is determined by combining the task's own priority with the priority of its entire parent chain. For example: `Plan(High).Sub-Plan(Medium).Task(High)`.
    - Sort the list of ready tasks from highest to lowest aggregated priority.

**Exit Criteria:** The AI has produced a sorted list of tasks that are ready for implementation.

---

## Phase 3: Report Generation

**Goal:** To present the prioritized list of ready tasks in a clear and actionable format.

1.  **AI Assistant's Action: Generate Implementation Plan Report**

    - Create a markdown table with the following columns:
      - **Aggregated Priority**: The calculated priority string (e.g., `H.M.H`).
      - **Task**: The name of and a link to the `*.task.md` file.
      - **Planning Estimate**: The story points for the task.
      - **Status**: The current status of the task.
    - Present this table to the human developer.

2.  **Human's Action: Review and Select Work**
    - Review the prioritized list.
    - Select the next task(s) to be implemented.

**Outcome:** A clear, data-driven implementation plan is generated, allowing developers to confidently select the most important and unblocked work.
