# Workflow: Implementation Review

**Objective:** To review the source code's architectural alignment and quality, assuming its functional correctness has already been verified by a robust and approved test suite.

**Participants:** Human Developer, AI Assistant

**Trigger:** The `Test Implementation Review` for a task is complete, and the developer is ready for the source code review.

> **Note:** For detailed instructions on using the CLI, see the main [README.md](../../README.md).

## Core Principles of a Workflow Document

A workflow document is not passive documentation; it is an **executable instruction set** for an AI assistant. Every workflow we create must adhere to the following principles:

- **Single, Prime Objective:** Each workflow must have a single, clearly defined `Objective`.
- **Defined Trigger:** The specific event that initiates the workflow must be stated.
- **Clear Participants:** The roles (e.g., Human Developer, AI Assistant) must be listed.
- **Phased Approach:** The workflow must be broken down into logical phases, each with a clear goal.
- **Action-Oriented Steps:** Each step must be a clear, actionable instruction for a specific participant.
- **Checkpoints & Outcomes:** Each phase must conclude with a verifiable checkpoint and a defined outcome or exit criteria.

## Workflow Artifacts

This workflow generates the following artifacts, which are stored in a directory named after the task ID.

- **Path Pattern**: `docs/workflow/<task_id>/`
- **Generated Reports**:
  - `implementation-review.md`: A comprehensive report of the entire implementation review.

    - Verify that the `Test Implementation Review` for the task has been completed and the test suite was approved.
    - Read the provided `*.task.md` and its full parent hierarchy (`*.plan.md` files) to build complete context.

3.  **Checkpoint: Readiness Confirmation**
    - The AI Assistant confirms that the prerequisite is met and it has the full context.
    - _"The test suite has been approved. I have reviewed the documentation and am ready to review the implementation."_

**Exit Criteria:** The AI Assistant has confirmed the test suite is approved and has a full contextual understanding of the work.
