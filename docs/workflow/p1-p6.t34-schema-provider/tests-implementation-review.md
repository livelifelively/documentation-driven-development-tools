# Test Suite Review: T34 Schema Provider

This document summarizes the review of the test suite for the task **T34: Schema Provider Implementation**.

## 1. Coverage Report

This section maps each Acceptance Criterion (AC) from the task's `7.1 Testing Strategy / Requirements` to the corresponding test cases.

| AC ID | DoD Link | Scenario | Covered By - `schema-provider.test.ts`: `describe('createSchemaProvider', () => { it('should expose getDocumentSchema and validate methods', ...); })` | ✅ Covered |
| AC-2 | DoD-3 | Valid task Section[] validates successfully via provider | - `schema-provider.integration.test.ts`: `describe('Realistic Document Validation', () => { it('should validate a realistic task Section[] payload successfully', ...); })` | ✅ Covered |
| AC-3 | DoD-4 | Invalid fields map to `LintingError[]` with correct paths/messages | - `schema-provider.test.ts`: `describe('createSchemaProvider', () => { it('should map invalid fields to LintingError[] with correct paths/messages', ...); })` | ✅ Covered |
| AC-4 | DoD-6 | No tight coupling to parser internals (types-only) | - `schema-provider.test.ts`: `describe('createSchemaProvider', () => { it('should not have tight coupling to parser internals (types-only)', ...); })` | ✅ Covered |

## 2. Quality Assessment

The test suite for the `SchemaProvider` is comprehensive and well-structured.

- **Coverage**: The tests cover all acceptance criteria outlined in the task documentation. There are both unit tests for individual functions and integration tests that validate realistic document payloads.
- **Robustness**: The tests include positive and negative scenarios. They check for successful validation, error handling, and correct mapping of validation errors to the `LintingError` format.
- **Edge Cases**: The unit tests cover error conditions like schema composition failure. The integration tests use realistic data structures, which implicitly cover many edge cases of a real-world document.
- **Clarity**: The tests are clearly written and easy to understand. The use of `vi.mock` to isolate the `SchemaProvider` from its dependencies is a good practice and demonstrates a well-architected test setup.

## 3. Recommendations

The test suite is excellent and meets all requirements. No significant gaps were identified.

One minor suggestion for future improvement could be to add a test case for a completely empty `DocumentData` object to ensure it's handled gracefully, although the current tests for invalid data likely cover this implicitly.

**Overall Status**: ✅ **Approved**

The test suite is complete and correct. The implementation is ready for the next stage of review.
