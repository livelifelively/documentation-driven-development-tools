# Workflow: Human-Led Implementation Review

## Workflow Definition

### Objective

To conduct a thorough, human-driven review of newly implemented code, using tests and a debugger to validate, refine, and extend the code with direct human oversight.

### Participants

- Human Developer
- AI Assistant

### Trigger

AI-led implementation of a Task is complete, and the work is ready for a detailed, interactive review by a human.

### Control Model

**Human-Led (Instructional)** - The Human Developer provides specific, step-by-step instructions. The AI Assistant executes these instructions precisely and waits for the next command.

## Core Principles of a Workflow Document

A workflow document is not passive documentation; it is an **executable instruction set** for an AI assistant. Every workflow we create must adhere to the following principles:

- **Single, Prime Objective:** Each workflow must have a single, clearly defined `Objective`.
- **Defined Trigger:** The specific event that initiates the workflow must be stated.
- **Clear Participants:** The roles (e.g., Human Developer, AI Assistant) must be listed.
- **Phased Approach:** The workflow must be broken down into logical phases, each with a clear goal.
- **Action-Oriented Steps:** Each step must be a clear, actionable instruction for a specific participant.
- **Checkpoints & Outcomes:** Each phase must conclude with a verifiable checkpoint and a defined outcome or exit criteria.

## High-Level Phases

- **Phase 1: Setup and Initial Review**
- **Phase 2: Interactive Debugging and Refinement**
- **Phase 3: Finalization and Documentation Sync**
