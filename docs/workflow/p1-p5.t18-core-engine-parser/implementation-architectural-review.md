# Architectural Alignment Report for Task: Core Engine & Markdown Parser

## Architecture Compliance Score: 95%

The implementation shows excellent alignment with the target architecture defined in `docs/requirements/p1-p5.t18-core-engine-parser.task.md`. The overall structure, component responsibilities, and data flow match the design.

## Component Implementation Status

| Component                        | Implemented | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ParserApi (`index.ts`)**       | ✅ Yes      | Correctly exposes `parseTask` and `lintTask` and delegates to the `CoreEngine`.                                                                                       |
| **CoreEngine**                   | ✅ Yes      | Orchestrates the parsing process as designed, using its dependencies correctly.                                                                                       |
| **MarkdownParser**               | ✅ Yes      | Properly uses `remark` to generate the AST.                                                                                                                           |
| **PluginManager**                | ✅ Yes      | Dynamically loads plugins using `glob` as specified.                                                                                                                  |
| **AstSlicer**                    | ✅ Yes      | Correctly slices the AST by Level 2 headings.                                                                                                                         |
| **SectionProcessor (Interface)** | ✅ Yes      | The interface in `plugin.types.ts` matches the design.                                                                                                                |
| **SchemaValidator**              | ❌ No       | This component was defined in the plan but not implemented in this task. It is scheduled for `p1-p5.t26-schema-validation-utils.task.md`, so this is not a deviation. |
| **StatusPlugin**                 | ❌ No       | This is a proof-of-concept plugin scheduled for a future task (`p1-p5.t19-poc-plugin-status.task.md`), so its absence is expected.                                    |

## Interface Compliance Issues

- **None.** The public API in `index.ts` and the internal `SectionProcessor` interface are fully compliant with the architectural design.

## Dependency Violations

- **None.** The dependency flow is correct. The `CoreEngine` depends on the `MarkdownParser`, `PluginManager`, and `AstSlicer`. The public API depends on the `CoreEngine`. There are no circular dependencies.

## Architectural Recommendations

The architecture is well-implemented. No critical corrections are needed.

- **Minor Suggestion**: The `CoreEngine` constructor allows for a `PluginManager` to be injected, which is good for testing. However, the `loadPlugins` method is still part of the public API. For cleaner separation of concerns, the `CoreEngine` could be made responsible for telling the `PluginManager` when to load plugins, rather than the external caller. This is a minor point and does not represent a deviation from the plan.

**Conclusion:** The implementation is architecturally sound and provides a solid foundation for the subsequent tasks of implementing the schema validator and plugins.
