## ‚úÖ 2 Business & Scope

### ‚úÖ 2.1 Overview

<!-- Provide a concise, bulleted list outlining what this task delivers and why it matters. -->

- **Core Function**: Defines and implements the core TypeScript interfaces for the in-memory project data model.
- **Key Capability**: Creates the foundational data structures (`ProjectModel`, `ModuleModel`, `EpicModel`, `TaskModel`) that the rest of the parser will use to build the in-memory representation of the documentation.
- **Business Value**: Establishes a clear, typed contract for the project's data structure, ensuring consistency and enabling type-safe development for all subsequent logic.

### ‚úÖ 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

<!-- A verifiable, tabular list of conditions that this task must satisfy to be considered complete. -->

| ID   | Criterion                                                                                                                                  | Test Reference    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| AC-1 | A file `src/modules/analyzer/models.ts` is created containing all the required interfaces.                                                 | N/A (Code Review) |
| AC-2 | The file exports a `Document` base interface containing `path` and `rawContent` properties.                                                | N/A (Code Review) |
| AC-3 | The file exports `ProjectModel`, `ModuleModel`, `EpicModel`, and `TaskModel` interfaces.                                                   | N/A (Code Review) |
| AC-4 | Each model interface extends the `Document` interface and includes a property for its direct children (e.g., `modules` in `ProjectModel`). | N/A (Code Review) |

## ‚ùì 3 Planning & Decomposition

### ‚úÖ 3.3 Dependencies

<!-- List any internal or external dependencies that could block the progress of this task. -->

This task has no dependencies.

---

## ‚úÖ 4 High-Level Design

### ‚ùì 4.1 Current Architecture

None (Greenfield).

### ‚úÖ 4.2 Target Architecture

This task involves creating a single file with TypeScript interface definitions.

#### ‚úÖ 4.2.1 Data Models

<!-- "To-be" data structures (ER diagrams). -->

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Document {
        string path
        string rawContent
    }

    ProjectModel ||--|{ ModuleModel : contains
    ModuleModel ||--|{ EpicModel : contains
    EpicModel ||--|{ TaskModel : contains

    ProjectModel }|..|{ Document : extends
    ModuleModel }|..|{ Document : extends
    EpicModel }|..|{ Document : extends
    TaskModel }|..|{ Document : extends
```

#### ‚úÖ 4.2.2 Components

This task creates type definitions, not runtime components.

---

## ‚úÖ 5 Maintenance and Monitoring

This task creates type definitions and has no runtime maintenance or monitoring implications.

---

## ‚úÖ 6 Implementation Guidance

### ‚úÖ 6.1 Implementation Plan

<!-- A direct, "one-shot" overview of the technical approach for this work item. -->

Create a new file, `src/modules/analyzer/models.ts`, and define the required TypeScript interfaces for the project's in-memory data model.

### ‚úÖ 6.2 Implementation Log / Steps

<!-- A detailed, step-by-step log of the implementation process for this task. -->

1.  [x] Create the file `src/modules/analyzer/models.ts`.
2.  [x] Define and export a base `Document` interface with `path: string` and `rawContent: string`.
3.  [x] Define and export the `TaskModel` interface, extending `Document`.
4.  [x] Define and export the `EpicModel` interface, extending `Document` and including `tasks: TaskModel[]`.
5.  [x] Define and export the `ModuleModel` interface, extending `Document` and including `epics: EpicModel[]`.
6.  [x] Define and export the `ProjectModel` interface, extending `Document` and including `modules: ModuleModel[]`.

## ‚úÖ 7 Quality & Operations

### ‚úÖ 7.1 Testing Strategy / Requirements

<!-- The approach to testing and specific testing requirements for this task. -->

This task produces only TypeScript type definitions, which do not have a runtime component to test directly. Quality will be ensured through:

1.  **Code Review**: A peer will review the created interfaces for correctness and adherence to the plan.
2.  **Consuming Task Tests**: The unit and integration tests for the `Content Parser` (Task T3) will implicitly validate these types by attempting to build and use them. If the types are incorrect, the `Content Parser` tests will fail.

### ‚úÖ 7.5 Local Test Commands

<!-- CLI commands to run tests locally. -->

N/A. This task does not produce testable code.
