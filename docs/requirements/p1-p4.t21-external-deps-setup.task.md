## 2 Business & Scope

### 2.1 Overview

- **Core Function**: This task covers the manual, one-time setup of external accounts and secrets required for automated NPM publishing.
- **Key Capability**: Ensures the CI/CD pipeline has the necessary permissions to publish to the NPM registry.
- **Business Value**: Unblocks the entire automated release process, which is critical for project launch.

#### 2.2.3 Core Business Rules

None. This task is purely procedural.

### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

| ID   | Criterion                                                                            | Test Reference |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| AC-1 | An NPM account exists with access to the `@livelifelively` organization.             | Manual Check   |
| AC-2 | An NPM Access Token with "publish" permissions is generated.                         | Manual Check   |
| AC-3 | The token is securely stored as a secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in the GitHub repository. | Manual Check   |

## 3 Planning & Decomposition

### 3.3 Dependencies

None. This task is a prerequisite for other tasks (e.g., `t16`) but has no preceding dependencies within this plan.

---

## 4 High-Level Design

None (inherits from parent). This task is purely procedural.

---

## 5 Maintenance and Monitoring

None (inherits from parent). This task is purely procedural and introduces no new components to monitor.

## 6 Implementation Guidance

### 6.1 Implementation Plan

None. The steps below are to be followed sequentially.

### 6.1 Implementation Log / Steps

1.  [ ] **Gain NPM Organization Access**: Ensure your NPM user account has "Member" or "Admin" permissions for the `@livelifelively` organization on npmjs.com.
2.  [ ] **Generate NPM Access Token**:
    - Go to your NPM account's "Access Tokens" page.
    - Click "Generate New Token" and select the "Automation" type. This is important as it's designed for CI/CD and bypasses 2FA.
    - Give the token a descriptive name (e.g., `ddd-tools-ci`).
    - Copy the generated token immediately. You will not be able to see it again.
3.  [ ] **Create GitHub Repository Secret**:
    - Navigate to the `livelifelively/documentation-driven-development-tools` GitHub repository.
    - Go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
    - Click "New repository secret".
    - Name the secret `NPM_TOKEN`.
    - Paste the copied access token into the "Value" field.
    - Click "Add secret".

#### 6.1.1 Initial Situation

- The `@livelifelively` organization exists on NPM.
- The `livelifelively/documentation-driven-development-tools` repository exists on GitHub.
- An `NPM_TOKEN` secret does not yet exist in the repository's Actions secrets.

#### 6.1.2 Files Change Log

None. This task involves manual configuration in external systems (NPM, GitHub) and does not modify any files in this repository.

### 6.2 Prompts (LLM reuse)

None.

## 7 Quality & Operations

### 7.1 Testing Strategy / Requirements

| AC  | Scenario                          | Test Type | Tools / Runner | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-- | :-------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 | Verify NPM token is set correctly | Manual    | GitHub Actions | The ultimate test for this task is the successful execution of the `t16-automated-npm-publish-ci` task. A successful `npm publish` step in that workflow's log will confirm that the `NPM_TOKEN` secret was configured correctly. |

### 7.2 Configuration

None. The configuration of the `NPM_TOKEN` is the deliverable of this task itself.

### 7.3 Alerting & Response

None.

### 7.5 Local Test Commands

None.
