| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| AC-1        | The `src/schema` directory contains the `schema.zod.ts` file.            | N/A (File existence verified by test imports)                                                                     | ✅ Covered |
| AC-2        | Zod schemas are defined for all nested objects.                          | `describe` blocks for all schemas                                                                                 | ✅ Covered |
| AC-3        | Zod schemas are detailed enough for validation.                          | All `it` blocks combining happy/sad paths                                                                         | ✅ Covered |
| AC-4        | The Zod schemas are exported from the file.                              | N/A (Verified by successful test imports)                                                                         | ✅ Covered |
| AC-5        | The `src/schema` directory contains the `schema.types.ts` file.          | N/A (File existence)                                                                                              | ✅ Covered |
| AC-6        | The `src/schema` directory contains the `ddd-schema-json` sub-directory. | N/A (File existence verified by integration tests)                                                                | ✅ Covered |
| **T-2/T-3** | **All schema types have comprehensive "sad path" tests.**                | `it('should fail validation for invalid ...')` tests for each schema.                                             | ✅ Covered |
| **T-4**     | **ContentElementSchema validates all content types.**                    | `it('should validate a valid ContentElement with ... type')` for `list`, `text`, `table`, `codeblock`, `mermaid`. | ✅ Covered |
| **T-5**     | **Real JSON files in schema directory pass validation.**                 | `describe('Integration Tests - Real JSON Files')`                                                                 | ✅ Covered |

## 2. Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Test Suite Robustness

The test suite is now robust and comprehensive.

- **Complete "Sad Path" Coverage**: All schemas now have dedicated tests that assert validation failure for objects with incorrect data types and missing required fields. This fully addresses the primary gap identified in the first review.
- **Complete Content Type Coverage**: The `ContentElementSchema` tests now correctly validate all specified content types (`text`, `list`, `table`, `codeblock`, `mermaid`), including a test for recursive children.
- **Integration with Real Data**: The addition of integration tests that parse and validate every `*.json` file in the `src/schema/ddd-schema-json` directory provides a strong guarantee that the schemas accurately reflect the real-world data they are intended to govern.

## 3. Recommendations

None. The test suite is now considered complete and correct according to the task documentation. The implementation is ready for the next stage of review.
