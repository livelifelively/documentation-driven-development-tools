## 2 Business & Scope

### 2.1 Overview

- **Core Function**: To create and maintain a comprehensive `README.md` file for the `ddd-tools` repository.
- **Key Capability**: The `README.md` will serve as the primary entry point for new users, explaining the project's purpose, features, and usage.
- **Business Value**: A high-quality README is crucial for project adoption, developer onboarding, and establishing clear, accessible documentation for the toolset.

| AC-1 | A `README.md` file is created at the root of the repository.                                                |
| AC-2 | The README includes sections for Project Title, Description, Installation, and Usage.                       |
| AC-3 | The Usage section provides clear examples for the `ddd template` and `ddd start` commands.                  |

### 3.3 Dependencies

| ID  | Dependency On                                | Type     | Status         | Notes                                                                            |
| :-- | :------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D-1 | Finalized CLI commands (`template`, `start`) | Internal | ⏳ In Progress | The README content depends on the final implementation of the core CLI commands. |
| D-2 | `p1-p2.t4-init-commands.task.md`             | Internal | 💡 Not Started | The README must describe the core documents provided by the `init` command.      |

## 4 High-Level Design

None. This task is for creating a `README.md` file, which is a documentation artifact. It does not have its own internal architecture; it describes the project's features, which are designed in other documents.

---

## 5 Maintenance and Monitoring

None. As a static documentation file, the `README.md` does not have operational components that require maintenance or monitoring. Its maintenance is covered by the implementation steps in section 6.

## 6 Implementation Guidance

### 6.1 Implementation Log / Steps

- [ ] **Create File**: Create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory.
- [ ] **Title and Badge**: Add a main title `# DDD Tools` and a placeholder for an NPM version badge.
- [ ] **Description**: Write a project description based on the `p1.p2-cli-tools.plan.md` overview. Explain that the tool helps enforce Documentation-Driven Development.
- [ ] **Core Concepts**:
  - Briefly explain the DDD workflow: `Document -> Implement -> Validate`.
  - Mention the Plan/Task hierarchy.
  - Add a note that running `ddd init` in a project will create a `docs/` directory containing the core methodology and schema documents for detailed reference.
- [ ] **Installation**: Add a section explaining how to install the tool globally (`npm install -g @livelifelively/ddd-tools`).
- [ ] **Usage Section**: Create a main "Usage" section with subsections for each command.
- [ ] **`ddd template`**:
  - Explain its purpose: creating new plan and task files.
  - Provide usage syntax: `ddd template <type> <name> --parent <parent-filename>`.
  - Include examples for creating a root plan, a nested plan, and a task, based on `p1-p2.t3-template-commands.task.md`.
- [ ] **`ddd start`**:
  - Explain its purpose: starting work on a task.
  - Provide usage syntax: `ddd start <task_id>`.
  - Describe what it does: creates a `task/<task_id>` branch and updates the task file's status.
- [ ] **Global Flags**:
  - Add a small section explaining that `ddd --help` can be used to see all commands and `ddd --version` shows the installed version.
- [ ] **Local Development**:
  - Add a section explaining how contributors can set up the project locally using `npm install` and `npm link` to test their changes.
- [ ] **Contributing**: Add a brief section about contributing, mentioning that the project itself follows the DDD methodology.
- [ ] **Review**: Review the entire document for clarity, grammar, and formatting.

### 6.1.1 Initial Situation

- No `README.md` file exists in the repository.
- Project information is scattered across various task and plan documents.

### 6.1.2 Files Change Log

- `README.md` (New)

## 7 Quality & Operations

### 7.5 Local Test Commands

```bash
# No direct tests for README.md, but its content should be manually
# verified against the implemented features.
ddd --help
```
