## 2 Business & Scope

### 2.1 Overview

- **Core Function**: To create a Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow using GitHub Actions that automatically publishes the `ddd-tools` package to the NPM registry.
- **Key Capability**: The workflow will trigger on the push of a new version tag, ensuring that every versioned release is built, tested, and published consistently.
- **Business Value**: Automating the release process eliminates the risk of manual error, reduces the effort required for new releases, and ensures a reliable and repeatable deployment pipeline.

#### 2.2.3 Core Business Rules

- The workflow MUST only trigger on tags matching the pattern `v*.*.*`.
- The workflow MUST run the full test suite and build the project before attempting to publish.
- The workflow MUST fail and prevent publishing if either the tests or the build fails.
- The NPM authentication token MUST be stored securely as a GitHub secret and not exposed in the workflow logs.

### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

| ID   | Criterion                                                                                           |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-1 | A workflow file is created at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.                                      |
| AC-2 | The workflow successfully triggers when a new tag matching `v*.*.*` is pushed to the repository.    |
| AC-3 | The workflow job successfully installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs all tests.        |
| AC-4 | The workflow job successfully publishes the package to the NPM registry using a secret `NPM_TOKEN`. |
| AC-5 | The workflow job fails if any step before the publish step fails.                                   |

## 4 High-Level Design

_Inherits overall design from parent plan [p1.p4-npm-publication.plan.md](./p1.p4-npm-publication.plan.md)._

### 4.2 Target Architecture

#### 4.2.1 Data Models

This diagram shows the relationship between the Git repository, the CI workflow, and the NPM registry.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    GIT_REPOSITORY {
        string tag
    }
    GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW {
        string trigger
        string job
    }
    NPM_REGISTRY {
        string packageName
        string version
    }

    GIT_REPOSITORY ||--|{ GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW : "triggers"
    GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW ||--|{ NPM_REGISTRY : "publishes to"
```

#### 4.2.2 Components

The main components are the workflow definition and the external NPM service it interacts with.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class GitHubActionsWorkflow {
        <<YAML File>>
        +name: "Publish to NPM"
        +trigger: "on push tags"
        +runTests()
        +runBuild()
        +publishToNpm()
    }

    class NpmRegistry {
        <<External Service>>
        +receivePackage(package, token)
    }

    GitHubActionsWorkflow --> NpmRegistry : "pushes package to"
```

#### 4.2.3 Data Flow

This shows the flow of artifacts and triggers through the CI/CD pipeline.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Git Tag Push] --> B(GitHub Actions Trigger)
    B --> C[CI Job Starts]
    C --> D[Code Checkout]
    D --> E[NPM Dependencies]
    E --> F(Run Tests)
    F --> G(Run Build)
    G --> H[JS Artifacts]
    H --> I(NPM Publish)
    I --> J[NPM Registry]
```

#### 4.2.4 Control Flow

The control flow is orchestrated by GitHub Actions based on the workflow definition.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Git
    participant GitHubActions
    participant NPM

    Git->>GitHubActions: Push tag 'v*.*.*'
    activate GitHubActions
    GitHubActions->>GitHubActions: Run job 'publish'
    GitHubActions->>GitHubActions: Execute steps sequentially
    GitHubActions->>NPM: npm publish
    activate NPM
    NPM-->>GitHubActions: Success/Failure
    deactivate NPM
    deactivate GitHubActions
```

#### 4.2.5 Integration Points

- **Upstream**: GitHub repository (triggering on tag push).
- **Downstream**: NPM registry (publishing the package).

---

## 5 Maintenance and Monitoring

### 5.2 Target Maintenance and Monitoring

#### 5.2.1 Error Handling

- **Workflow Failures**: If any step in the workflow fails, GitHub Actions will stop the run, mark it as failed, and send a notification email to the user who pushed the tag.
- **Debugging**: Detailed logs for each step are available in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository, allowing for post-mortem analysis of failed runs.

---

## 6 Implementation Guidance

### 6.1 Implementation Log / Steps

- [ ] Create the directory structure `.github/workflows/`.
- [ ] Create a new file named `publish.yml` inside the new directory.
- [ ] Add the following content to the `publish.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/publish.yml
  name: Publish to NPM

  on:
    push:
      tags:
        - 'v*.*.*'

  jobs:
    publish:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Setup Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: '18'
            registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
        - name: Install Dependencies
          run: npm ci
        - name: Test
          run: npm test
        - name: Build
          run: npm run build
        - name: Publish
          run: npm publish --access public
          env:
            NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  ```

- [ ] Navigate to the GitHub repository's "Settings" -> "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions".
- [ ] Create a new repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` and paste a valid NPM publish token into the value field.

## 7 Quality & Operations

### 7.1 Testing Strategy / Requirements

| AC ID | Scenario                      | Test Type  | Tools / Runner       | Notes                                                                 |
| :---- | :---------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-2  | Workflow triggers on tag push | Manual E2E | `git push --tags`    | A test tag (e.g., `v0.0.1-test`) can be pushed to verify the trigger. |
| AC-4  | Package is published          | Manual E2E | `npm view ddd-tools` | After a successful run, check the NPM registry for the new version.   |

### 7.2 Configuration

- **`NPM_TOKEN`**: This is the only configuration required. It must be a repository secret in GitHub.

### 7.5 Local Test Commands

- It is not possible to run this workflow locally. It must be tested by pushing a tag to the GitHub repository.
